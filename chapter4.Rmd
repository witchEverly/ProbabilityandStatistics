# Random Variables

The concept of random variables allows us to explore what is unknown, or governed by randomness. We define a random variable as a real-valued function that maps any given event/outcome of a random experiment to a real number. The most formal, [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic "Axiomatic") definition of a random variable involves [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory "Measure theory").

$$
X:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Support Set**

-   An event/outcome of a random experiment that is a subset from our sample space.

-   The support set is the set of possible values of $X$.

-   The domain of a random variable is all possible values that the random variable X can take on.

-   Is discrete or continuous depending on the data.

-   A random variable is not the same as it's probability distribution.

    -   A probability distribution is more of a blueprint for all of the possible values that a random variable can take on, i.e. the support.
    -   "Don't confuse the map with the territory."
    -   There are many different mistakes that can be made by thinking random variable(s) abide by the same rules as something like a PMF. Multiple random variable can add up to a value greater than one.

-   A random variable is a representation of the possible outcomes of a random process, while the probability distribution provides a way to describe the likelihood or probability of each possible outcome.

-   Random Variable Example: The outcome of a coin toss can be represented by a random variable that takes the value 1 if the coin lands heads and 0 if it lands tails.

## Transformations of Random Variables

A transformed variable will have a new distribution with different characteristics compared to the original distribution.

**Transformations on a single random variable**

Linear transformation

-   A linear transformation of a random variable X can be defined as Y = aX + b, where a and b are constants.

-   Scales or shifts the variable.

    -   When scaling remember that probability of the sample space is 1.

1.  Exponential transformation: Y = e\^X.

2.  Logarithmic transformation: A logarithmic transformation of a random variable X defined as Y = log(X).

3.  Box-Cox transformation: The Box-Cox transformation is a family of power transformations that can be used to stabilize the variance of a random variable. The transformation is defined as Y = [(X\^λ)-1]/λ, where λ is an estimator.

4.  Square root transformation: Defined as Y = sqrt(X). This transformation can be useful in situations where the data is non-negative and the variance is proportional to the mean.

5.  Inverse transformation: An inverse transformation of a random variable X can be defined as Y = 1/X. This transformation can be useful in situations where the data is expressed in ratios or rates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example transformations on multiple random variables**

\*EXAMPLES 1-6 ARE FROM CHATGPT\*

1.  Linear transformation: A linear transformation of X, Y, and Z can be defined as W = aX + bY + cZ, where a, b, and c are constants. This transformation can be useful in situations where we want to combine the information from three variables into a single variable.

2.  Multiplication: Multiplying three random variables X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = XYZ. This can be useful in situations where we are interested in the product of three variables.

3.  Division: Dividing two random variables X and Y can result in a new random variable W = X/Y/Z. This can be useful in situations where we want to normalize one variable by two others.

4.  Addition: Adding three random variables X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = X + Y + Z. This can be useful in situations where we are interested in the sum of three variables.

5.  Subtraction: Subtracting three random variables X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = X - Y - Z. This can be useful in situations where we are interested in the difference between three variables.

6.  Function transformation: Applying a function to X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = f(X,Y,Z). This can be useful in situations where we want to transform the variables in a non-linear way.

In general, we can think of transforming n random variables using the above methods by defining a new random variable W as a function of the n variables, such as W = f(X1,X2,\...,Xn). The choice of transformation will depend on the specific problem and the goals of the analysis.

**Additional Notes**

-   We can have several random variables defined on a sample space.

-   Consider trying to randomly plot points on a plane in a circle, or within a boundary. this is a transformation on two random variables (X and Y are (x,y))

## Distribution Functions

Definition: A distribution function of a random variable $X$ is a function $F$ from $(-\infty, +\infty)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ defined by$F(t)=P(X \le t)$. The CDF characterizes a random variable.

Properties

From the definition of a distribution function, the following properties are determined:

1.  F(t) is non-decreasing
2.  F(t) is right continuous
3.  satisfies $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}= 1$
4.  satisfies $\lim_{t \rightarrow -\infty}= 0$

If the above properties are satisfied then we have a CDF.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$
F_X(t) = P(X \le t) = \sum_{\{x \in R_x | x\le t\}} p_X(x)\tag{Discrete}
$$

$$
F(t) = P(X \le t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} f_X(x) dx \tag{Continuous} 
$$

**Additional Notes**

-   For discrete random variables, CDF's are step functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the CDF to Calculate Probabilities

Recall that the CDF can characterize a random variable, how is this done? Considered the events that are represented as the following inequalities, if $P(X \le t)$ is known for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$ all of the following events can be calculated

$$
(X \le a)  \qquad (X < a) \qquad (X \ge a) \qquad (X > a) \qquad (X = a) 
$$

$$
(a \le X \le b) \qquad (a < X < b) \qquad (a < X \le b) \qquad (a \le X < b) 
$$

**Discrete Case**

| $P(X \ge x)=1 - P(X)$                    |     |
|------------------------------------------|-----|
| $P(X > a)=1 - P(X\le a)$                 |     |
| $P(X < x)=1 - P(X)$                      |     |
| $P(X = x)=1 - P(X\le)$                   |     |
| $P(a < X \le b)= P(X\le a) - P(X\le a-)$ |     |
| $P(a \le X < b)=1 - P(X\le)$             |     |
| $P(a \le X \le b)=1 - P(X\le)$           |     |
| $P(a < X < b)=1 - P(X\le)$               |     |

: The CDF is defined as $F(X) = P(X \le x)$. Use these relations to find the following probabilities

**Continuous Case**

The nature of continuous data makes calculating probabilities using the CDF much simpler. This is because of the way by which we integrate to calculate these continuous probabilities.

$$
P(a<X<b)=P(a\leq X<b)=P(a<X\leq b)=P(a\leq X\leq b)=\int_{a}^{b} f(t) \, dt
$$

To find other probabilities, while we could re-integrate with different bounds on out CDF,
