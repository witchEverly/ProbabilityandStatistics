# Hello, World!

***In probability**, we solve forwards. It starts with an exact and well-defined rule. We use this rule to predict what will happen in the future. We don't know the results, but probability allows us to quantify what should happen. **In statistics**, we solve backwards. It starts with the end results, known as data. We take this data and try to determine what well-defined rules created it.*

This guide is written from a theoretical perspective, aiming to distill the theories of probability. This work is a reflection of my commitment to sharing the beauty and complexity of statistical sciences. If you appreciate this please star the repository. Should you find any discrepancies, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/witchEverly/ProbabilityandStatistics/issues) via GitHub. The repository for this book can be found [here](https://github.com/witchEverly/ProbabilityandStatistics). Additionally, much of these notes I found easy to write out after reading *Fundamentals of Probability, with Stochastic Processes* by Saeed Ghahramani.
