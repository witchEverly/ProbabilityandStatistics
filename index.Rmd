# Introduction

This is a book of notes for math, probability, and statistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***In probability**, we solve forwards. It starts with an exact and well-defined rule. We use this rule to predict what will happen in the future. We don't know the results, but probability allows us to quantify what should happen. **In statistics**, we solve backwards. It starts with the end results, known as data. We take this data and try to determine what well-defined rules created it.*
