Avoid using a mobile browser with the current version. In probability, we solve forwards. It starts with an exact and well-defined rule. We use this rule to predict what will happen in the future. We don’t know the results, but probability allows us to quantify what should happen. In statistics, we solve backwards. It starts with the end results, known as data. We take this data and try to determine what well-defined rules created it.

The rule states that the number different possible outcomes for a sequence of \\(n\\) stages is the product of the number of different ways each event can occur. \\[ \\text{Let }E_1, E_2, ..., E_k \\text{ be sets of events, where each set has }n_1,n_2, ...,n_k \\text{ respective elements.} \\\\ \\text{Then there are }n_1×n_2×n_3×···×n_k \\text{ combinations in which we, first,} \\\\ \\text{choose an element of }E_1, \\text{then choose element of }E_2, \\text{ ... , ending with } E_k. \\] Combinatorial principles - Wikipedia The counting principal can be visualized with a tree graph.

From the generalized counting principle we know that if we have \\(n\\) ways to make the first selection, then we will have one fewer way to make our next selection, and so on… until we only have one option for the last selection. This results in the factorial equation \\[ (n)(n−1)(n−2)···(1)=n! \\] We use the notation \\(_nP_r\\) to denote the number of permutations of a set \\(A\\) containing \\(n\\) elements taken \\(r\\) at a time where \\((1 ≤ r ≤ n)\\) The number of r-element permutations of a set containing n objects is given by \\[ _nP_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\] Note: To avoid division by zero when \\(n=r\\) we define \\(0! = 1\\) To derive the formula for \\(_nP_r\\) we consider the number of choices for each selection. Considering \\(n\\) elements, the number of choices for the first object in the \\(r\\)-element permutation is \\(n\\). For the next selection there will be \\(n-1\\) options, followed by \\(n-2\\) options for the selection that follows after that, just like the first case we examined– we do this until our last selection. However, we are now considering an \\(r\\)-element permutation not an \\(n\\)-element permutation. In this case, the \\(r\\)th outcome can take on \\(n − (r − 1)\\) possible choices, as opposed to the case before where we had only one option for the last selection. _____ _____ _____ ... _____ (n) (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-(r-1)) We accounting for the ways you can permeate \\(r\\) objects, the result \\(n - (r - 1)\\) is the number of objects taken into account. This leads us to the equation \\[ _nP_r =n(n−1)(n−2)···(n−r+1) \\] Aside: Permutations with \\(_nP_n\\) equate to \\[ _nP_n =n(n−1)(n−2)···(n−n+1)=n! \\] Manipulating the equation \\(n(n−1)(n−2)···(n−r+1)\\) leads us to the general formula \\[ _nP_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\] 3.2.1 Permutations with Replacement By applying the counting principle, we can observe that the number of permutations in replacement sampling is equivalent to \\[ n^k = (n)(n)....(n_k) \\] 3.2.2 Permutations with distinguished elements The formulas above are valid only if all of the objects of the set are distinguishable from each other. If there are repeated elements then we must divide to cancel out the permutations that result from repeated elements like so: \\[ \\frac{n!}{n_1! × n_2 ! × · · · × n_k!} \\] Consider the names Brungard and Karapanian. If for some reason we wanted to know the possible ways to rearrange the letters of each of word we would have Brungard \\[ \\frac{8!}{2!} = 20,160 \\] Karapanian Here are ten letters, but only six are distinct \\[ \\frac{10!}{4! *2!}= 75,600 \\] While there are still more ways to permute the longer last name, consider that if you did not account for repeated characters, the overcount will exceed three million. factorial(10) - factorial(10)/(factorial(4)*factorial(2)) [1] 3553200 3.3 Combinations we have for \\(r \\le n\\) \\[ \\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\] We are calculating the number of \\(r\\)-element subsets from a \\(n\\)-element set, where order matters. This is the number of all r-element combinations of n objects, where we only use valid non-negative integers (e.g. 0,1,2, …) where \\(r \\le n\\). [need add derivation] 3.3.1 Combinations with replacement \\[ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} \\] 3.3.2 Useful Relations Choosing all and choosing nothing There is only one combination to choose all elements in a set. Similarly, there is only one way to choose nothing. \\[ \\binom{n}{n}=1 \\qquad \\&amp; \\qquad \\binom{n}{0}=1 \\] Both relations can be easily be shown algebraically \\[ \\binom{n}{n}=\\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!}=1 \\] Choosing 1 from n objects is the same as choosing n-1 fron n objects \\[ \\binom{n}{1}=\\binom{n}{n-1} \\] consider this generalization where \\(0 \\le r \\le n\\) \\[ \\binom{n}{r}=\\binom{n}{n-r} \\] and \\[ \\binom{n+1}{r}=\\binom{n}{r}+\\binom{n}{r-1} \\] 3.4 Number of Sets in a Subset The set of all subsets of A is called the power set of A. We can calculate the number of subsets in a set as \\(2^n\\), because each element can be either included or excluded (hence the two options) ## Examples [coming soon] ## Practice Problems [coming soon] ## Binomial Expansion [coming soon] "],["conditional-probability.html", "Chapter 4 Conditional Probability 4.1 Reduction of a Sample Space 4.2 Law of Multiplication 4.3 Bayes’ Formula 4.4 Monty Hall Problem, Explained:", " Chapter 4 Conditional Probability Conditional probability is not a theorem, nor a conjecture. It is not a lemma or a corollary. It aims to answer the question of how you should update probability based on updated evidence. It is philosophically intuitive idea that the conditional probability \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\) gives an advantage, when knowing the occurrence of \\(B\\) changes the occurrence of \\(A\\). The probability of \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\) is given by the ratio of the relative frequency of the intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and the relative frequency of \\(B\\). We can interpret this as the ratio of the probability of joint occurrence of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and the probability of \\(B\\). We define conditional probability as \\[ \\mathbb{P}(A|B)=\\frac{\\mathbb{P}(AB)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)} \\] where \\(\\mathbb{P}(B)&gt;0\\). Set Theory Interpretation: \\(P(AB)\\) is the intersection of common elements between sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Joint occurrence better describes the probability that events are to occur. 4.0.1 Conditional Probability is a Probability Measure That is, they satisfy the same axioms that ordinary probabilities satisfy. This enables us to use the theorems that are true for probabilities for conditional probabilities as well. 4.1 Reduction of a Sample Space It is possible to reduce a sample space e.g. from (S to B) and have a smaller set of subsets. Making it easier to calculate conditioned probabilities. 4.2 Law of Multiplication Understand that conditional probability represents the relation between \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\) and \\(\\frac{\\mathbb{P}(AB)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}\\) where \\(\\mathbb{P}(B) &gt; 0\\). By simply multiplying both sides by the \\(\\mathbb{P}(B)\\), The law of multiplication demonstrates that probability of the joint occurrence of A and B is the product of the probability of B and the conditional probability of A given that B has occurred. \\[ \\mathbb{P}(AB)=\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\mathbb{P}(B), \\text{ where } \\mathbb{P}(B)&gt;0 \\] also, \\[ \\mathbb{P}(AB)=\\mathbb{P}(BA)=\\mathbb{P}(B|A)\\mathbb{P}(A), \\text{ where } \\mathbb{P}(A) &gt; 0 \\] We can also calculate the joint probability of three events by using association laws.

Consider that the partitioned sample space we imagine for the law of total probability. With Bayes’ Rule we are update our belief about something given that we know some other event is true or has occurred. We want to calculated the probability of an unknown event occurring. examining the hypothesis given evidence is true we arrive at the expression \\[ P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) \\cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \\] \\(P(H|E)\\) represents the probability of hypothesis \\(H\\) given evidence \\(E\\). \\(P(E|H)\\) denotes the probability of observing evidence \\(E\\) given the hypothesis \\(H\\). \\(P(H)\\) is the prior probability of hypothesis \\(H\\) \\(P(E)\\) represents the probability of observing evidence \\(E\\).

This conclusion falsely assumes independence; that Monty has a choice between the two doors, i.e. he is choosing between them at random. The issue is that this does not constitute the full conditioning of the evidence provided to us. We possess additional knowledge that the door selected was door two. In the event that we switch doors, we can reason that between the originally picked door (e.g. door 1), and the closed door paired with one that we know is a goat, doors 2 and 3 What does this mean; it means that before conditioning we have a one third chance of door 1 having the car, the complement is 2/3 and after conditioning we know that door between door two and three one of them must have a must have the car because it is not is a there was a From this we can infer this through a table Those "],["random-variables.html", "Chapter 5 Random Variables 5.1 Transformations of Random Variables 5.2 Distribution Functions", " Chapter 5 Random Variables The concept of random variables allows us to explore what is unknown, or governed by randomness. We define a random variable as a real-valued function that maps any given event/outcome of a random experiment to a real number. The most formal, axiomatic definition of a random variable involves measure theory. \\[ X:\\Omega\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\] Support Set An event/outcome of a random experiment that is a subset from our sample space. The support set is the set of possible values of \\(X\\). The domain of a random variable is all possible values that the random variable X can take on. Is discrete or continuous depending on the data. A random variable is not the same as it’s probability distribution. A probability distribution is more of a blueprint for all of the possible values that a random variable can take on, i.e. the support. A random variable is a representation of the possible outcomes of a random process, while the probability distribution provides a way to describe the likelihood or probability of each possible outcome. Random Variable Example: The outcome of a coin toss can be represented by a random variable that takes the value 1 if the coin lands heads and 0 if it lands tails. 5.1 Transformations of Random Variables A transformed variable will have a new distribution with different characteristics compared to the original distribution. Transformations on a single random variable Linear transformation A linear transformation of a random variable X can be defined as Y = aX + b, where a and b are constants. Scales or shifts the variable. When scaling remember that probability of the sample space is 1. Exponential transformation: Y = e^X. Logarithmic transformation: A logarithmic transformation of a random variable X defined as Y = log(X). Box-Cox transformation: The Box-Cox transformation is a family of power transformations that can be used to stabilize the variance of a random variable. The transformation is defined as Y = [(X^λ)-1]/λ, where λ is an estimator. Square root transformation: Defined as Y = sqrt(X). This transformation can be useful in situations where the data is non-negative and the variance is proportional to the mean. Inverse transformation: An inverse transformation of a random variable X can be defined as Y = 1/X. This transformation can be useful in situations where the data is expressed in ratios or rates. Example transformations on multiple random variables Linear transformation: A linear transformation of X, Y, and Z can be defined as W = aX + bY + cZ, where a, b, and c are constants. This transformation can be useful in situations where we want to combine the information from three variables into a single variable. Multiplication: Multiplying three random variables X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = XYZ. This can be useful in situations where we are interested in the product of three variables. Division: Dividing two random variables X and Y can result in a new random variable W = X/Y/Z. This can be useful in situations where we want to normalize one variable by two others. Addition: Adding three random variables X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = X + Y + Z. This can be useful in situations where we are interested in the sum of three variables. Subtraction: Subtracting three random variables X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = X - Y - Z. This can be useful in situations where we are interested in the difference between three variables. Function transformation: Applying a function to X, Y, and Z can result in a new random variable W = f(X,Y,Z). This can be useful in situations where we want to transform the variables in a non-linear way. In general, we can think of transforming n random variables using the above methods by defining a new random variable W as a function of the n variables, such as W = f(X1,X2,...,Xn). The choice of transformation will depend on the specific problem and the goals of the analysis. Additional Notes We can have several random variables defined on a sample space. Consider trying to randomly plot points on a plane in a circle, or within a boundary. this is a transformation on two random variables (X and Y are (x,y)) 5.2 Distribution Functions Definition: A distribution function of a random variable \\(X\\) is a function \\(F\\) from \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by\\(F(t)=P(X \\le t)\\). The CDF characterizes a random variable. Properties From the definition of a distribution function, the following properties are determined: F(t) is non-decreasing F(t) is right continuous satisfies \\(\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty}= 1\\) satisfies \\(\\lim_{t \\rightarrow -\\infty}= 0\\) If the above properties are satisfied then we have a CDF. Recall that the CDF can characterize a random variable, how is this done? Considered the events that are represented as the following inequalities, if \\(P(X \\le t)\\) is known for all \\(t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) all of the following events can be calculated \\[ (X \\le a) \\qquad (X &lt; a) \\qquad (X \\ge a) \\qquad (X &gt; a) \\qquad (X = a) \\] \\[ (a \\le X \\le b) \\qquad (a &lt; X &lt; b) \\qquad (a &lt; X \\le b) \\qquad (a \\le X &lt; b) \\] \\[ F_X(t) = P(X \\le t) = \\sum_{\\{x \\in R_x | x\\le t\\}} p_X(x)\\tag{Discrete} \\] \\[ F(t) = P(X \\le t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} f_X(x) dx \\tag{Continuous} \\] Additional Notes For discrete random variables, cdfs are step functions. P(X = a) = 0 PDF and PMF are derived from the CDF The probability integral transform theorem is also known as the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox or the Borel-Kolmogorov theorem: t can be shown that there exists a sample space S with a probability function and a random variable X over S such that the distribution function of X is F.

PMF \\[ \\begin{equation} p(x) = P(X = x)= \\begin{cases} p &amp; \\text{if } x = 1\\\\ 1 - p = q &amp; \\text{if } x = 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } x \\not\\in R_x \\end{cases} \\end{equation} \\] Parameter Details \\[ 0 \\le p \\le 1 \\] Spread / Dispersion Equations \\[ E(X) = p \\qquad Var(X) = p(1-p) \\qquad \\sigma_x = \\sqrt{p(1-p)} \\] Additional Notes A Bernoulli random variable is an indicator function. Alternative expressions for the Bernoulli pmf include:: \\[ P(X = k) = p^k (1-p)^{(1-k)} \\quad k \\in \\{0,1\\} \\] Bernoulli pmf takes on two discrete values, and it jumps abruptly from one value to the other at the point where the value of the random variable changes from 0 to 1, which can be shown graphically with its CDF. This is similar to other discrete random variables. can be generalized to more than 2 outcomes Bernoulli trial is an experiment with two possible outcomes, this is not the same as a Bernoulli random variable… or a Bernoulli process. 7.2 Binomial Random Variables \\[ X \\sim Binom(n,p) \\quad R_x = \\{0,1,2,...,n\\} \\] A binomial random variable is used for determining the number of successes in a fixed number of i.i.d. Bernoulli trials, this is the sum of independent indicator random variables \\(X = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + ... + X_n\\) i.i.d. means that each of the random variables that we sum to find \\(X\\) (as shown above) are independent, and have the same distribution (which in this case is \\(X_n ~ Bern(p)\\)), all of which have the same fixed probability of success. For example, flipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads would be an example of a binomial random variable. Calculating where X = 3 (or any value of x in the support set) would be a result obtained from the random variable. Parameter Details p = probability of success, n = number of trials parameters n and p represents the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a fixed probability of success, denoted by p. PMF \\[ \\begin{equation} p(x) = P(X= x) = \\begin{cases} \\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} &amp; \\text{if } x = 0,1,2,...,n\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } x \\not\\in R_x \\end{cases} \\end{equation} \\] Spread / Dispersion Equations \\[ E(X) = np \\quad Var(X) = np(1-p) \\quad \\sigma_x = \\sqrt{np(1-p)} \\] Additional Notes The name is the binomial expression is given because of the use of the binomial expansion theorem used to show that p is a pmf finding the maximum (pg. 182) The binomial distribution is the basis for the popular binomial test of statistical significance A binomial random variable that has a single success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli trial or Bernoulli experiment, and a sequence of outcomes is called a Bernoulli process; 7.3 Geometric Random Variables \\[ X \\sim Geo(p) \\qquad R_x = \\{1,2,3,...\\} \\] A geometric random variable is used to find the number of trials that are needed to get the first success in a Bernoulli process (a sequence of *iid* Bernoulli trials is called a Bernoulli process). In other words, a geometric random variable represents the number of failures that occur before the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. The probability distribution of a geometric random variable is derived from the Bernoulli distribution. Note that Bernoulli random variable is a single experiment, binomial is n experiments, but geometric is infinitely many experiments. PMF \\[ \\begin{equation} p(x) = P(X= x) = \\begin{cases} p(1-p)^{x-1} &amp; \\text{if } x = 1,2,...,n\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } x \\not\\in R_x \\end{cases} \\end{equation} \\] Parameter Details 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 p each obs the same probability of success, namely p Spread / Dispersion Equations \\[ E(X) = \\frac{1}{p} \\qquad Var(X) = \\frac{1-p}{p^2} \\quad \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-p}}{p} \\] Additional Notes The case where there are infinite trials without success… Often used to model situations where you repeatedly perform a binary experiment. Memoryless property: “independent trials do not have a memory”, considering what happens upon conditioning a geometric random. Applies to the geometric distribution as \\(P( X &gt; a + b | x &gt; a ) = P ( x &gt; b )\\) \\(E(X)\\) is obviously the average number of trials, knowing the past does not affect the future.. While we have examined the number of trials that are needed to get the first success in a Bernoulli process, the distribution can also be used to denote the number of failures before the first success, in which case the support would obviously begin at 0 instead of 1, and the pmf would look a bit different also. 7.4 Negative Binomial Random Variables \\[ X \\sim Geom(r,p) \\qquad R_x = {r, r + 1, r + 2, r + 3, ...} \\] A negative binomial random variable is a generalization of a geometric random variable, where \\(X\\) represents the number of trials/experiments until the \\(rth\\) success occurs Parameter Details r, p PMF \\[ p(x; r,p) = P(X= x) = \\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^r(1-p)^{x-r}, \\qquad 0 &lt; p &lt; 1, \\qquad x = r, r + 1, r + 2, ... \\] Spread / Dispersion Equations \\[ E(X) = \\frac{r}{p} \\qquad Var(X) = \\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2} \\quad \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\sqrt{r(1-p})}{p} \\] Additional Notes many alternative formulations aka the pascal distribution 7.5 Hypergeometric Random Variables \\[ X \\sim HyperGeometric(D, N, n) \\qquad R_x = \\{0,1,2,...\\} \\] n are drawn at random and without replacement.

(e.g. lottery tickets sold and winner tickets). This is because a Poisson probability mass function is the limit of a binomial probability mass function. Aside from approximating the binomial distribution, The Poisson distribution appears in connection with the study of sequences of random events occurring over time.
